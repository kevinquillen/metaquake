# Metaquake

Repo to preserve a great Quake mod, MetaQuake.

## Installation

Download the latest release from the releases page. Unpack to your Quake game root directory, where you see the Id1 folder. It will look like this:

```
Quake
  - Id1
  - meta
```

Run the game with the flag `-game meta` to load the game files. You can do this in Steam by changing the game properties.
