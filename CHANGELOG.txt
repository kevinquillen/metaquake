METAMORPHISM QUAKE V6.0.4
=========================

Release Notes
-------------------------------

Fixes the in-game help menu not working in QuakeWorld. Press backspace to enter help during the game!


METAMORPHISM QUAKE V6.0.3
=========================

Release Notes
-------------------------------

Contains a series of fixes so that the code in the /qw/ folder will compile for QuakeWorld.

Updated the README with information on how to setup nQuake to run meta for QuakeWorld.

Fixed a bug where the mvdsv server would crash on player respawn.


METAMORPHISM QUAKE V6.0.2
=========================

Release Notes
-------------------------------

Fixed some text strings and updated the README. This version fixes a game crashing bug
by just hiding it for now.

- https://github.com/kevinquillen/metaquake/commit/50555b2fe9e698492c7b9343052201d91b1b7d1d

As a result, certain maps no longer crash.

METAMORPHISM QUAKE V6.0.1
=========================

Release Notes
-------------------------------

Fixed some issues with character encodings that I could find so far. It looks like
there could have been characters lost in translation from the 2011 update and editing
with a code editor, and then myself running git svn clone without preserving source
encoding. My bad.

The donut glyphs are back in the help menu and MOTD text. I was able to track down
their value here:

https://icculus.org/~marco/quakec/fteqcc_manual.txt

Fixed a few typos and updated the console log text.


METAMORPHISM QUAKE V6.0.0
=========================

Release Notes
-------------------------------
This is a modified version of Metamorphism v5 (often called just "Meta5")
originally by Lon Hohberger. He released the source under the GPL license and
so this is too. This release aims to keep the same spirit of the game, but any
changes you don't like can't be blamed on Lon. ;)

There are 6 sections.

1) NEW WEAPONS/SPELLS - Describes any new weapons or spells added to the game.
2) GAMEPLAY CHANGES - Describes any changes that affect the balance of the game.
3) CHANGED WEAPONS/SPELLS - Describes changes to existing weapons/spells.
4) MISC. CHANGES - Non-gameplay related changes
5) BUGS FIXED - Fixes to bugs in Meta.
6) CODE BASE CHANGES - For developers. Changes in the code structure.

1) New Weapons/Spells
-------------------------------
* SSG 31: Sawed Barrel Shotgun
    It deals a lot of damage up close, but spreads out quickly at a short range
    Ideal for melee opponents or grappling hook kills.
    Cost: 4 shells / 1.2s reload.

* Readded Lich's "Darkness" spell.
    This was commented out, but it is pretty cool. It makes the level extremely
    dark (removes all static lighting). Future versions might just reduce the
    lighting effects of dynamic lights instead of darkening the entire area.
* Mage Spell: Confusion
    An area of effect spell that causes enemies to be confused. They become
    severely disoriented for a few seconds.
* Cleric Spell: Aid
    Aid gives the caster or target a bonus health over their maximum. If the
    player isn't at full health, then it functions like a heal spell. The bonus
    health is not treated as a maximum health, so once hurt, it is not possible
    to pick up a health box and restore it.
* Druid Spell: Regeneration
    Similar to the D&D spell, Regeneration causes the target to heal damage over
    time. The spell may be cast on the caster or target and heals 5 health per 
    second for 15 seconds (75 health total). 
 
2) Gameplay Changes
-------------------------------
* Standard Quake Guy added back in and is the default upon entering.
* Changing classes to the Standard Quake Guy does not deduct a frag.
* Changing classes to the class you already have selected does not deduct a frag
* Soldier now starts with 35 green armor (was 0)
* Fire Elemental now takes damage from water and is healed by lava like it was
  in Meta 3.
* Removed handicap system, looks like it was only partially functioning.
* Added a new damage type of "Cold" which is separate from "Water" of previous.
  Meta 5 used water damage to represent cold, which was confusing when the
  player died from water and the game showed a cold-related message.
* Added the Rune of Mana similar to Meta 3 (faster mana regen + higher capacity)
  NOTE: Original Quake doesn't show > 255 ammo (mana) in the bars, so the 
  counter appears to return to zero even when the player still has more mana.
  In other words, if you get the rune and see your mana go back to zero, don't
  panic! The server keeps track of the proper amount of mana.
* Lich no longer removes land mines when walking on them. I don't know what
  this was supposed to have meant before, but its gone now...
* Originally, classes had binary resistance to magic. If you had "magic
  resistance" then you were immune to a number of effects. This system was
  redone for all spells. Now, each spell has a base percent chance to affect
  each player. This base chance is is then modified by +/- 25% depending on
  whether the player is resistance to magic or weak to magic. Finally,
  the percent chance is clamped to [5%, 95%], meaning you always have at
  least a 5% chance of being affected by a spell, and no greater than a 95%
  chance to resist its effects.
* Cleric's Sanctuary now just reduces damage by 20% and can be toggled.
* Renamed Cleric's "Feebleness" spell to "Dispel Evil" since it really throws
  out the player's (evil) runes.
* Renamed Cleric's "Cure" to just "Heal"
* Renamed Cleric's "Heal" to "Group Heal" to better convey what it does
* Renamed Cleric's "Strengthen Armor" to "Magical Vestment" so it sounds
  more D&D like.
* Added "Berserk" class. High health, some armor, and a deadly sword. At
  the moment, missing a ranged attack. There will likely be some balance
  changes related to this later.
  
3) Changed Weapons/Spells
-------------------------------
* The Lich's "Acid Blob" spell had its damage reduced from 100-220 to 80-120,
  its mana cost reduced from 40 to 30, and no longer harms the caster. Due to
  limitations of the Quake Engine, sometimes the blob deflects the option
  rocket. There isn't really a fix for this that is suitable, so I guess you
  just have to aim better.
* The Lich's "Ice Lance" spell had its damage reduced from 100-350 to 40-65.
  The spell was ridiculously overpowered and usually capable of 1-hit killing
  anyone and everyone, especially considering the fire rate and low, low
  mana cost.
* The Fire Elementals' "Beam" spell had its damage reduced by 1/2 and fire
  rate slowed down. It did huge damage extremely rapidly and silently making
  it extremely overpowered. It also now makes a soft sound effect.
* Cleric's "Holy Aura" spell was entirely broken, perhaps only partially 
  implemented, in Meta 5. Its behavior was something to the effect of
  doubling the caster's health, but only if the caster was at full health
  and armor; otherwise, it would harm the caster for 30 health/6 seconds
  until the caster died. Very random.
* Cleric's "Divinity" spell no longer gives everyone in a huge radius pentagram.

4) Misc. Changes
-------------------------------
* (Re)Added the Meta help system.
* Changed a few death messages.
* Added 4 new death messages for when the player gets a kill as the dog.
* Added the "spell effects" system, which tracks what spells have been cast
  on the player and how long until they expire. This replaces a lot of the
  ad-hoc code and makes a more generalized framework for spells that affect
  players for a certain amount of time. It additionally allows players to
  see when a spell expires, what its name was, and who cast it. All of
  the player-affecting spells have been re-written to take advantage of
  this. From a developer's standpoint, it makes it easier to track down
  problems in spells, or add new and interesting effects easily.

5) Bugs Fixed (compared to Meta 5)
-------------------------------
* When a Druid kills someone as a demon, the death message no longer reads
  "...by his chain lightning".
* When a Mage kills someone as a dog, the death message no longer reads
  "...by his lightning".
* When a class had extra fall damage (specialist/heavy weaps/base guard),
  their damage was actually multiplied by 1.95 instead of 1.5. This has been
  changed back to 1.5x since it was assumed that the double damage amplification
  was an unintentional effect.
* When a player is killed with radiation suit, the server incorrectly used the
  quad damage time instead of the radiation suit to figure out how much
  radiation suit to throw. It appears that code to actually throw unused
  radition suit time was not completed however.
* When picking up the armor rune, it was supposed to switch green armor to
  yellow armor on pickup, but it did not due to a minor typo. Now it does
  correctly.
* When moving and entering help, the player's weapon no longer bobs around.
* Resistance to "Inceneration" was incorrectly comparing damage amount to
  damage type flags, which usually led to incorrect compuation of damage.
* The handicap was set to 0% sometimes, resulting in immunity to damage.
* Classes that do not drown no longer make gasping sounds when surfacing
  from water.
* Drowning damage computation didn't make any sense. It added 2 damage then
  immediately doubled it, then set the damage back to 10 if it was larger than
  15. Drowning now just simply starts at 2 damage and adds 2 points per
  second up to 12 damage/sec.
* Drowning no longer gives a message implying cold damage ("cooled", "chilled",
  etc.)
* Scouts had double resistance to snipers. Instead of 40% damage reduction,
  they got 76%. This was fixed back to 40% like normal damage resistances.
* The Lich's "Acid Blob" doesn't explode when it hits an option rocket.
* The option rocket doesn't explode when it hits something owned by the
  player (e.g. spell effects)
* Fixed case where Druids were unable to pick up health after leaving the
  demon morph. The code doubles the druid's maximum health when s/he enters
  demon state, but cuts it in 1/3 when leaving, which actually sets the maximum
  health LOWER than when starting.
* Fixed case where Druids with 1 or 2 health in demon form returning to human
  form looked like they were dead, but weren't.
* Fixed Mage's maximum armor being set to 75 when exiting from dog morph,
  instead of being restored to 80.
* Fixed Druid's maximum armor being set to 120 when exiting from demon morph,
  instead of being restored to 115.
* Fixed Mage's dog stand animation. It accidentally went 1 frame too far and
  cause a graphical glitch.
* The dog's jump attack code actually was set to use the demon's jump, causing
  it to do too much damage. It now does normal damage (25-35)

6) Code Base Changes
-------------------------------
* Tons of comments added to existing code to improve readability
* Reformatted some code to use tabs (tab = 4 spaces in my editor)
* Added common/weapons/ssg.c for super shotgun improvements
* Added common/class/berserk.c for berserk animation and attacking
* Added magic.h for magic related symbols
* Added spellfx.c for the spell effect system.
* Renamed mglobals.h -> meta.h
* Removed some stuff from globals.qc/magic.qc and put into meta.h/magic.h. This
  should reduce the number of global variables (and size of the progs code) and
  hopefully make it more maintainable.
* All of the Quake/*.qc files have been replaced with *.c files and are
  preprocessed using GCC
* Unused Quake/*.qc files were removed.
